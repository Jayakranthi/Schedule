# Schedule Trip

Getting Started: 
To get you started you can simply clone the TripPlanner repository and install the dependencies:

Prerequisites: 
I used Node.js tools to initialize and test TripPlanner. You must have Node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.

Steps to Run: 
1. run 'npm install -g yo bower gulp gulp-cli' 
2. run 'npm install' 
3. run 'gulp serve'

Application will open in default browser.
